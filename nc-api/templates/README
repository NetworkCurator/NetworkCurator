# README for templates

This folder should hold files with extension .txt. Each file is a template for an
automated email sent from the NetworkCurator API to users. 

The first line in each template should start with a hash and will be interpreted as
the email subject. 

Following lines will form the body of the email. 

Templates can contain placeholders that will be filled-in by the automated sender. The
format is to enclose a simple string in brackets, e.g. [FIRSTNAME].
